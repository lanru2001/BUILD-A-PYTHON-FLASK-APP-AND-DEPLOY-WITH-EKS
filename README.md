Creating a basic Flask Application

To create a Flask application we need to install the Flask package for python. But before we do that it is advisable to always create a virtual environment so that everything we will do doesnâ€™t affect the Python installed on our machine.

Step 1: Installations
Create the application directory:
mkdir my_flask_app
cd my_flask_app

Install python virtual environment with pip: 
pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment for our app:
virtualenv venv

Activate the virtual environment we created:
source venv/bin/activate

Install the Flask package:
pip install Flask

Save all the packages in a file:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

Step 2: Build the Flask Application
The first step in creating our flask application is to create a file and name it app.py. Then open the file with your preferred IDE or editor to start coding.
